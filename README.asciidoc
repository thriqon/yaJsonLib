yaJsonLib
=========

This is yet another Json-Library for Java. It is very simple, and fits
nicely into the Java stream system.


Usage
-----

It can be used like an ObjectOutputStream. Objects are written to
the stream using writeObject(Object).

Recognized Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JSON-types are mapped according to the following list:

Arrays::
	Iterable<T>
	Object[]

Object::
	Map<K,V>

String::
	all other types


ToDo
----

* proper number formatting
